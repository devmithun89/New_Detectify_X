export const aiPlusHuman = `Cheese is a rich source of protein and calcium, and is also a good source of other nutrients, such as vitamin D, vitamin A, and phosphorus. It is often used as a topping on sandwiches and pizzas, as well as a flavor enhancer in a variety of dishes, such as pasta and salads.

For a few cheeses, the milk is curdled by adding acids such as vinegar or lemon juice. Most cheeses are acidified to a lesser degree by bacteria, which turn milk sugars into lactic acid, then the addition of rennet completes the curdling. Vegetarian alternatives to rennet are available; most are produced by fermentation of the fungus Mucor miehei, but others have been extracted from various species of the Cynara thistle family. Cheesemakers near a dairy region may benefit from fresher, lower-priced milk, and lower shipping costs.`;

The primary objective is to score points by shooting the basketball through the opponent's hoop, which is mounted on a backboard 10 feet (3.048 meters) above the ground. The team with the most points at the end of the game wins. Basketball is played on a rectangular court, typically indoors, with a surface made of wood or synthetic materials. The rules and regulations are governed by various organizations, such as FIBA (International Basketball Federation) and the NBA (National Basketball Association). The following is a general outline of the basic rules of basketball:

1. Game duration: A regulation basketball game is divided into four quarters, each lasting 12 minutes in the NBA and 10 minutes in FIBA play. College basketball in the US has two 20-minute halves. If the game is tied at the end of regulation, overtime periods are played until a winner is determined.

2. Starting play: The game begins with a jump ball at the center of the court, where the referee throws the ball into the air, and one player from each team tries to gain possession by tapping it to a teammate.

3. Scoring: Points are scored by shooting the ball through the hoop. A field goal made from inside the three-point arc is worth two points, while a field goal made from outside the arc is worth three points. Free throws, awarded after a foul, are worth one point each.

4. Possession and dribbling: A player in possession of the ball must either pass it to a teammate or dribble (bounce) the ball while moving.`;

export const human = `O say can you see, by the dawn’s early light,
What so proudly we hail’d at the twilight’s last gleaming,
Whose broad stripes and bright stars through the perilous fight
O’er the ramparts we watch’d were so gallantly streaming?
And the rocket’s red glare, the bombs bursting in air,
Gave proof through the night that our flag was still there,
O say does that star-spangled banner yet wave
O’er the land of the free and the home of the brave?

On the shore dimly seen through the mists of the deep
Where the foe’s haughty host in dread silence reposes,
What is that which the breeze, o’er the towering steep,
As it fitfully blows, half conceals, half discloses?
Now it catches the gleam of the morning’s first beam,
In full glory reflected now shines in the stream,
’Tis the star-spangled banner - O long may it wave
O’er the land of the free and the home of the brave!

And where is that band who so vauntingly swore,
That the havoc of war and the battle’s confusion
A home and a Country should leave us no more?
Their blood has wash’d out their foul footstep’s pollution.
No refuge could save the hireling and slave
From the terror of flight or the gloom of the grave,
And the star-spangled banner in triumph doth wave
O’er the land of the free and the home of the brave.

O thus be it ever when freemen shall stand
Between their lov’d home and the war’s desolation!
Blest with vict’ry and peace may the heav’n rescued land
Praise the power that hath made and preserv’d us a nation!
Then conquer we must, when our cause it is just,
And this be our motto - “In God is our trust,”
And the star-spangled banner in triumph shall wave
O’er the land of the free and the home of the brave.`;
